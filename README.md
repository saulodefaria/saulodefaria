# Hey, I’m Saulo Faria 👋

I’m a **Software Engineer** with **13+ years** building products people actually enjoy using — and that **move the needle** (growth, retention, conversion, churn, you name it).  
Currently, I’m at **Shippo**, helping build the shipping layer of the internet. 🚀

## What I’m about ✨
- 🧠 **Product-minded engineering** (I love thinking in outcomes, not just outputs)
- 🚀 **0 → 1 builder** — prototypes, MVPs, fast iterations, learning loops
- 📈 **KPI nerd** — I get genuinely excited about improving funnels and metrics
- 🤖 **AI enthusiast** — always exploring how to turn “cool models” into real product value
- ❤️ I love working on products that **make people’s lives better**

## Tech I use 🛠️
- **Go-to:** **JavaScript / TypeScript**
- **Also experienced with:** **Python**, **Go**, **Ruby on Rails**
- I’m comfortable across the stack: APIs, integrations, data flows, performance, and product experimentation.

## Fun fact 🍽️
I’ve built a few companies from scratch — including a **meal replacement brand** that sold to **thousands of customers across Brazil**, reaching **all 27 states** 🇧🇷  
(Yes, logistics and growth taught me as much as code did.)
